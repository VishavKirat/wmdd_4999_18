# week 03 Jan 17

## agenda
this week:  
  - triggering a function with API Gateway
  - using Integration Requests to pass data with a query string


## assignment 01

Using Lambda with API Gateway create a function that receives an event from a
query string and does something with that event. Your event data should be a
number (or two numbers, or three...) and your function should perform some sort
of simple math operation, adding two numbers together for example.
The actual functionality of your simple API is not that important, so keep it simple. The purpose of this assignment is
to gain familiarity with working with Lambda and API Gateway together, so the
important part is that your URL works.

Remember to test your function first, make sure that your function works then
move on to API Gateway.
