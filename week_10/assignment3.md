# Assignment 3, mini dropbox.

using S3, DynamoDB and Serverless you are going to create some of the
functionality for the backend of a miniature DropBox, file storage type of
application.

At this this stage of your application you only need to keep track of the
contents of an S3 bucket in a DynamoDB table. If a new file is added to your
bucket a record of this should be added to your database. If a file is deleted a
record of the files deletion should be added to your database.

for now this record only needs to include the name of the file and the date that
it was added or deleted.
